h5utils is a set of utilities for visualization and conversion of
scientific data in the free, portable HDF5 format.  HDF5 was developed
in the National Center for Supercomputing Applications at the
University of Illinois.

Besides providing a simple tool for batch visualization as PNG images,
h5utils also includes programs to convert HDF5 datasets into the
formats required by other free visualization software (e.g. plain
text, Vis5d, and VTK).

The included utilities are:

    * h5fromtxt and h5totxt: convert ASCII data (e.g. comma or tab
      delimited) to/from HDF5.
    * h5topng: convert 2d slices of HDF5 datasets to PNG images, with
      a variety of color tables and other options.
    * h5tov5d: convert HDF5 datasets to the format used by the free
      3d+ visualization tool Vis5d.
    * h5tovtk: convert HDF5 datasets to VTK format for use by the free
      Visualization ToolKit (along with supporting programs like MayaVi).
    * h5read.oct: a plug-in for GNU Octave (a Matlab-like program) to
      read 2d slices of HDF5 datasets (the latest versions of Octave
      include native support for HDF5).
    * h5fromh4: convert HDF (version 4) datasets to HDF5; mostly
      superceded by the h4toh5 program included with recent versins of HDF5.

This package is developed by Steven G. Johnson (stevenj@alum.mit.edu),
and is free software that should easily install under any Unix-like
operating system (e.g. GNU/Linux).
